==================

  * Fixed; combo $push and $pushAll auto-converts into a $pushAll [brian]
  * Fixed; combo $pull and $pullAll auto-converts to a single $pullAll [brian]
  * Fixed; $pullAll now removes said members from array before save (so it acts just
  like pushAll) [brian]

  Moreover, $pull now modifies the array before save to reflect the immediate
  change [brian]
