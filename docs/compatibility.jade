  h2 MongoDB Server Version Compatibility
  :markdown
    Mongoose relies on the [MongoDB Node.js Driver](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/)
    to talk to MongoDB. You can refer to
    [this table](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/node-js/)
    for up-to-date information as to which version of the MongoDB driver
    supports which version of MongoDB.
    
    Below are the [semver](http://semver.org/) ranges representing which
    versions of mongoose are compatible with the listed versions of MongoDB
    server.
    
    * MongoDB Server 2.4.x: mongoose `~3.8`, `4.x`
    * MongoDB Server 2.6.x: mongoose `~3.8.8`, `4.x`
    * MongoDB Server 3.0.x: mongoose `~3.8.22`, `4.x`
    * MongoDB Server 3.2.x: mongoose `>=4.3.0`
