    You can connect to MongoDB with the `mongoose.connect()` method.

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp');
    ```

    This is the minimum needed to connect the `myapp` database running locally
    on the default port (27017). If connecting fails on your machine, try using
    `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`.

    You can also specify several more parameters in the `uri`:

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://username:password@host:port/database?options...');
    ```

    See the [mongodb connection string spec](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/connection-string/) for more detail.

    <h3 id="buffering"><a href="#buffering">Operation Buffering</a></h3>

    Mongoose lets you start using your models immediately, without waiting for
    mongoose to establish a connection to MongoDB.

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp');
    var MyModel = mongoose.model('Test', new Schema({ name: String }));
    // Works
    MyModel.findOne(function(error, result) { /* ... */ });
    ```

    That's because mongoose buffers model function calls internally. This
    buffering is convenient, but also a common source of confusion. Mongoose
    will *not* throw any errors by default if you use a model without
    connecting.

    ```javascript
    var MyModel = mongoose.model('Test', new Schema({ name: String }));
    // Will just hang until mongoose successfully connects
    MyModel.findOne(function(error, result) { /* ... */ });

    setTimeout(function() {
      mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp');
    }, 60000);
    ```

    To disable buffering, turn off the [`bufferCommands` option on your schema](./guide.html#bufferCommands).
    If you have `bufferCommands` on and your connection is hanging, try turning
    `bufferCommands` off to see if you haven't opened a connection properly.
    You can also disable `bufferCommands` globally:

    ```javascript
    mongoose.set('bufferCommands', false);
    ```

    <h3 id="options"><a href="#options">Options</a></h3>

    The `connect` method also accepts an `options` object which will be passed
    on to the underlying MongoDB driver.

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect(uri, options);
    ```

    A full list of options can be found on the [MongoDB Node.js driver docs for `connect()`](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.2/api/MongoClient.html#connect).
    Mongoose passes options to the driver without modification, modulo a few
    exceptions that are explained below.

    * `bufferCommands`    - This is a mongoose-specific option (not passed to the MongoDB driver) that disables [mongoose's buffering mechanism](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/faq.html#callback_never_executes)
    * `user`/`pass`       - The username and password for authentication. These options are mongoose-specific, they are equivalent to the MongoDB driver's `auth.user` and `auth.password` options.
    * `autoIndex`         - By default, mongoose will automatically build indexes defined in your schema when it connects. This is great for development, but not ideal for large production deployments, because index builds can cause performance degradation. If you set `autoIndex` to false, mongoose will not automatically build indexes for **any** model associated with this connection.
    * `dbName`            - Specifies which database to connect to and overrides any database specified in the connection string. If you're using the `mongodb+srv` syntax to connect to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), you [should use `dbName` to specify the database](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48917591/fail-to-connect-mongoose-to-atlas/48917626#48917626) because you currently cannot in the connection string.

    Below are some of the options that are important for tuning mongoose.

    * `useNewUrlParser`   - The underlying MongoDB driver has deprecated their current [connection string](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/) parser. Because this is a major change, they added the `useNewUrlParser` flag to allow users to fall back to the old parser if they find a bug in the new parser. You should set `useNewUrlParser: true` unless that prevents you from connecting. Note that if you specify `useNewUrlParser: true`, you **must** specify a port in your connection string, like `mongodb://localhost:27017/dbname`. The new url parser does _not_ support connection strings that do not have a port, like `mongodb://localhost/dbname`.
    * `useCreateIndex`    - False by default. Set to `true` to make Mongoose's default index build use `createIndex()` instead of `ensureIndex()` to avoid deprecation warnings from the MongoDB driver.
    * `useFindAndModify`  - True by default. Set to `false` to make `findOneAndUpdate()` and `findOneAndRemove()` use native `findOneAndUpdate()` rather than `findAndModify()`.
    * `autoReconnect`     - The underlying MongoDB driver will automatically try to reconnect when it loses connection to MongoDB. Unless you are an extremely advanced user that wants to manage their own connection pool, do **not** set this option to `false`.
    * `reconnectTries`    - If you're connected to a single server or mongos proxy (as opposed to a replica set), the MongoDB driver will try to reconnect every `reconnectInterval` milliseconds for `reconnectTries` times, and give up afterward. When the driver gives up, the mongoose connection emits a `reconnectFailed` event. This option does nothing for replica set connections.
    * `reconnectInterval` - See `reconnectTries`
    * `promiseLibrary`    - sets the [underlying driver's promise library](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.1/api/MongoClient.html)
    * `poolSize`          - The maximum number of sockets the MongoDB driver will keep open for this connection. By default, `poolSize` is 5. Keep in mind that, as of MongoDB 3.4, MongoDB only allows one operation per socket at a time, so you may want to increase this if you find you have a few slow queries that are blocking faster queries from proceeding.
    * `bufferMaxEntries`  - The MongoDB driver also has its own buffering mechanism that kicks in when the driver is disconnected. Set this option to 0 and set `bufferCommands` to `false` on your schemas if you want your database operations to fail immediately when the driver is not connected, as opposed to waiting for reconnection.
    * `connectTimeoutMS`  - How long the MongoDB driver will wait before failing its initial connection attempt. Once Mongoose has successfully connected, `connectTimeoutMS` is no longer relevant.
    * `socketTimeoutMS`   - How long the MongoDB driver will wait before killing an inactive socket. A socket may be inactive because of either no activity or a long-running operation. This is set to `30000` by default, you should set this to 2-3x your longest running operation if you expect some of your database operations to run longer than 20 seconds.
    * `family`            - Whether to connect using IPv4 or IPv6. This option passed to [Node.js' `dns.lookup()`](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html#dns_dns_lookup_hostname_options_callback) function. If you don't specify this option, the MongoDB driver will try IPv6 first and then IPv4 if IPv6 fails. If your `mongoose.connect(uri)` call takes a long time, try `mongoose.connect(uri, { family: 4 })`

    Example:

    ```javascript
    const options = {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useCreateIndex: true,
      useFindAndModify: false,
      autoIndex: false, // Don't build indexes
      reconnectTries: Number.MAX_VALUE, // Never stop trying to reconnect
      reconnectInterval: 500, // Reconnect every 500ms
      poolSize: 10, // Maintain up to 10 socket connections
      // If not connected, return errors immediately rather than waiting for reconnect
      bufferMaxEntries: 0,
      connectTimeoutMS: 10000, // Give up initial connection after 10 seconds
      socketTimeoutMS: 45000, // Close sockets after 45 seconds of inactivity
      family: 4 // Use IPv4, skip trying IPv6
    };
    mongoose.connect(uri, options);
    ```

    See [this page](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.1/reference/faq/) for more information about `connectTimeoutMS` and `socketTimeoutMS`

    <h3 id="callback"><a href="#callback">Callback</a></h3>

    The `connect()` function also accepts a callback parameter and returns a
    [promise](./promises.html).

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect(uri, options, function(error) {
      // Check error in initial connection. There is no 2nd param to the callback.
    });

    // Or using promises
    mongoose.connect(uri, options).then(
      () => { /** ready to use. The `mongoose.connect()` promise resolves to undefined. */ },
      err => { /** handle initial connection error */ }
    );
    ```

    <h3 id="connection-string-options"><a href="#connection-string-options">Connection String Options</a></h3>

    You can also specify driver options in your connection string as
    [parameters in the query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)
    portion of the URI. This only applies to options passed to the MongoDB
    driver. You **can't** set Mongoose-specific options like `bufferCommands`
    in the query string.

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test?connectTimeoutMS=1000&bufferCommands=false');
    // The above is equivalent to:
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test', {
      connectTimeoutMS: 1000
      // Note that mongoose will **not** pull `bufferCommands` from the query string
    });
    ```

    The disadvantage of putting options in the query string is that query
    string options are harder to read. The advantage is that you only need a
    single configuration option, the URI, rather than separate options for
    `socketTimeoutMS`, `connectTimeoutMS`, etc. Best practice is to put options
    that likely differ between development and production, like `replicaSet`
    or `ssl`, in the connection string, and options that should remain constant,
    like `connectTimeoutMS` or `poolSize`, in the options object.

    The MongoDB docs have a full list of
    [supported connection string options](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/)

    <h3 id="keepAlive"><a href="#keepAlive">A note about keepAlive</a></h3>

    For long running applications, it is often prudent to enable `keepAlive`
    with a number of milliseconds. Without it, after some period of time
    you may start to see `"connection closed"` errors for what seems like
    no reason. If so, after
    [reading this](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/overview.html),
    you may decide to enable `keepAlive`:

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect(uri, { keepAlive: true, keepAliveInitialDelay: 300000 });
    ```

    `keepAliveInitialDelay` is the number of milliseconds to wait before initiating `keepAlive` on the socket.
    `keepAlive` is true by default since mongoose 5.2.0.

    <h3 id="replicaset_connections"><a href="#replicaset_connections">Replica Set Connections</a></h3>

    To connect to a replica set you pass a comma delimited list of hosts to
    connect to rather than a single host.

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]' [, options]);
    ```

    For example:

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://user:pw@host1.com:27017,host2.com:27017,host3.com:27017/testdb');
    ```

    To connect to a single node replica set, specify the `replicaSet` option.

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://host1:port1/?replicaSet=rsName');
    ```

    <h3 id="mongos_connections"><a href="#mongos_connections">Multi-mongos support</a></h3>

    You can also connect to multiple [mongos](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/) instances
    for high availability in a sharded cluster. You do
    [not need to pass any special options to connect to multiple mongos](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.0/tutorials/connect/#connect-to-sharded-cluster) in mongoose 5.x.

    ```javascript
    // Connect to 2 mongos servers
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://mongosA:27501,mongosB:27501', cb);
    ```

    <h3 id="multiple_connections"><a href="#multiple_connections">Multiple connections</a></h3>

    So far we've seen how to connect to MongoDB using Mongoose's default
    connection. At times we may need multiple connections open to Mongo, each
    with different read/write settings, or maybe just to different databases for
    example. In these cases we can utilize `mongoose.createConnection()` which
    accepts all the arguments already discussed and returns a fresh connection
    for you.

    ```javascript
    const conn = mongoose.createConnection('mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]', options);
    ```

    This [connection](./api.html#connection_Connection) object is then used to
    create and retrieve [models](./api.html#model_Model). Models are
    **always** scoped to a single connection.

    Mongoose creates a _default connection_ when you call `mongoose.connect()`.
    You can access the default connection using `mongoose.connection`.

    <h3 id="connection_pools"><a href="#connection_pools">Connection pools</a></h3>

    Each `connection`, whether created with `mongoose.connect` or
    `mongoose.createConnection` are all backed by an internal configurable
    connection pool defaulting to a maximum size of 5. Adjust the pool size
    using your connection options:

    ```javascript
    // With object options
    mongoose.createConnection(uri, { poolSize: 4 });

    const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test?poolSize=4';
    mongoose.createConnection(uri);
    ```

    <h3 id="v5-changes"><a href="#v5-changes">Option Changes in v5.x</a></h3>

    You may see the following deprecation warning if upgrading from 4.x to 5.x
    and you didn't use the `useMongoClient` option in 4.x:

    ```
    the server/replset/mongos options are deprecated, all their options are supported at the top level of the options object
    ```

    In older version of the MongoDB driver you had to specify distinct options
    for server connections, replica set connections, and mongos connections:

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect(myUri, {
      server: {
        socketOptions: {
          socketTimeoutMS: 0,
          keepAlive: true
        },
        reconnectTries: 30
      },
      replset: {
        socketOptions: {
          socketTimeoutMS: 0,
          keepAlive: true
        },
        reconnectTries: 30
      },
      mongos: {
        socketOptions: {
          socketTimeoutMS: 0,
          keepAlive: true
        },
        reconnectTries: 30
      }
    });
    ```

    In mongoose v5.x you can instead declare these options at the top level,
    without all that extra nesting.
    [Here's the list of all supported options](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.2/api/MongoClient.html).

    ```javascript
    // Equivalent to the above code
    mongoose.connect(myUri, {
      socketTimeoutMS: 0,
      keepAlive: true,
      reconnectTries: 30
    });
    ```

    <h3 id="next">Next Up</h3>

    Now that we've covered connections, let's take a look at [models](/docs/models.html).
