        h3 Bugfixes
        :markdown
          - Before starting to write code, look for existing [tickets](https://github.com/learnboost/mongoose/issues) or [create one](https://github.com/learnboost/mongoose/issues/new) for your specific issue. That way you avoid working on something that might not be of interest or that has been addressed already in a different branch.
          - Fork the [repo](https://github.com/learnboost/mongoose) _or_ for small documentation changes, navigate to the source on github and click the [Edit](https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button) button.
          - Write inline documentation for new methods or class members.
          - Write tests and make sure they pass (execute `make test` from the cmd line to run the test suite).
          - Follow the general coding style of the rest of the project (comma first, etc).

        h3 Documentation
        :markdown
          To contribute to the [API documentation](./api.html) just make your changes to the inline documentation of the appropriate [source code](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose/tree/master/lib) in the master branch and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). You might also use the github [Edit](https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button) button.

          To contribute to the [guide](./guide.html) or [quick start](./index.html) docs, make your changes to the appropriate `.jade` files in the [docs](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose/tree/master/docs) directory of the master branch and submit a pull request. Again, the [Edit](https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button) button might work for you here.

        h3 Plugins
        :markdown
          The [plugins](http://plugins.mongoosejs.com/) site is also an [open source project](https://github.com/aheckmann/mongooseplugins) that you can get involved with. Feel free to fork and improve it as well!
