# Mongoose for Enterprise

## Available as part of the Tidelift Subscription

Tidelift is working with the maintainers of Mongoose and thousands of other
open source projects to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the
open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time,
reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the
exact dependencies you use.

## Enterprise-ready open source software—managed for you

The Tidelift Subscription is a managed open source subscription for application
dependencies covering millions of open source projects across JavaScript,
Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, .NET, and more.

Your subscription includes:

- Security updates

  Tidelift’s security response team coordinates patches for new breaking security
  vulnerabilities and alerts immediately through a private channel, so your
  software supply chain is always secure.

- Licensing verification and indemnification

  Tidelift verifies license information to enable easy policy enforcement and
  adds intellectual property indemnification to cover creators and users in case
  something goes wrong. You always have a 100% up-to-date bill of materials for
  your dependencies to share with your legal team, customers, or partners.

- Maintenance and code improvement

  Tidelift ensures the software you rely on keeps working as long as you need it
  to work. Your managed dependencies are actively maintained and we recruit
  additional maintainers where required.

- Package selection and version guidance

  We help you choose the best open source packages from the start—and then
  guide you through updates to stay on the best releases as new issues arise.

- Roadmap input

  Take a seat at the table with the creators behind the software you use.
  Tidelift’s participating maintainers earn more income as their software is
  used by more subscribers, so they’re interested in knowing what you need.

- Tooling and cloud integration

  Tidelift works with GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and more. We support every
  cloud platform (and other deployment targets, too).

The end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade
software, for the full breadth of open source you use. That means less time
grappling with esoteric open source trivia, and more time building your own
applications—and your business.
