REST API fast? This is the one. This course is halfway
between _API Design_ and _Introduction to Mongoose_. It focuses more on
[Express](http://expressjs.com/), but also doesn't go into as much detail as _API Design_.

  <i>Mongoose for Application Development</i> by Simon Holmes
</a>

This is the book on Mongoose. Even though it is from 2013,
_Mongoose for Application Development_ has stood the test of time. This
book does an excellent job summarizing the core ideas that make Mongoose so
powerful. Just sub out callbacks for promises.

  <i>The Little MongoDB Schema Design Book</i> by Christian Kvalheim
</a>

Christian Kvalheim originally wrote the MongoDB Node.js driver in early 2010,
and maintained the driver almost singlehandedly until 2017. As maintainer
of the Node.js driver, Christian saw more Node.js+MongoDB code bases than
anyone, and his experience is unmatched.
This book distills 6 years of hard-learned lessons into concrete examples
of how to design MongoDB schemas for massive scale. If you want to learn
how to structure MongoDB schemas for an e-commerce store, a category tree, or a
blog that can support hundreds of millions of requests per day, this is
the book for you.
