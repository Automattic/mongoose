  h2 Middleware
  :markdown
    Middleware are functions which are passed control of flow during execution of document [init](./api.html#document_Document-init), [validate](./api.html#document_Document-validate), [save](./api.html#model_Model-save) and [remove](./api.html#model_Model-remove) methods. Middleware are executed at the document level, not the Model level.
    There are two types of middleware, `pre` and [post](#post). Let's start with `pre`.

  h3 Pre
  :markdown
    There are two types of `pre` middleware, serial and parallel.
  h4 Serial
  :markdown
    Serial middleware are executed one after another, when each middleware calls `next`.
  :js
    var schema = new Schema(..);
    schema.pre('save', function (next) {
      // do stuff
      next();
    });
  h4 Parallel
  p
    | Parallel middleware offer more fine-grained flow control.
  :js
    var schema = new Schema(..);
    schema.pre('save', true, function (next, done) {
      // calling next kicks off the next middleware in parallel
      next();
      doAsync(done);
    });
  :markdown
    The hooked method, in this case `save`, will not be executed until `done` is called by each middleware.
  h4 Use Cases
  p
    | Middleware are useful for atomizing model logic and avoiding nested blocks of async code. Here are some other ideas:
    ul
      li complex validation
      li
        | removing dependent documents
        ul
          li (removing a user removes all his blogposts)
      li asynchronous defaults
      li asynchronous tasks that a certain action triggers
        ul
          li triggering custom events
          li notifications
  h4 Error handling
  :markdown
    If any middleware calls `next` or `done` with an `Error` instance, the flow is interrupted, and the error is passed to the callback.
  :js
    schema.pre('save', function (next) {
      var err = new Error('something went wrong');
      next(err);
    });

    // later...

    myDoc.save(function (err) {
      console.log(err.message) // something went wrong
    });

  h3#post Post middleware
  :markdown
    [post](/docs/api.html#schema_Schema-post) middleware are executed _after_ the hooked method and all of its `pre` middleware have completed. `post` middleware do not directly receive flow control, e.g. no `next` or `done` callbacks are passed to it. `post` hooks are a way to register traditional event listeners for these methods.

  :js
    schema.post('init', function (doc) {
      console.log('%s has been initialized from the db', doc._id);
    })
    schema.post('validate', function (doc) {
      console.log('%s has been validated (but not saved yet)', doc._id);
    })
    schema.post('save', function (doc) {
      console.log('%s has been saved', doc._id);
    })
    schema.post('remove', function (doc) {
      console.log('%s has been removed', doc._id);
    })

  h3#next Next Up
  :markdown
    Now that we've covered `middleware`, let's take a look at Mongooses approach to faking JOINs with its query [population](/docs/populate.html) helper.
