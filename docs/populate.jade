    ## Populate

    MongoDB has the join-like [$lookup](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/) aggregation operator in versions >= 3.2. Mongoose has a more powerful alternative called `populate()`, which lets you reference documents in other collections.

    Population is the process of automatically replacing the specified paths in the document with document(s) from other collection(s). We may populate a single document, multiple documents, plain object, multiple plain objects, or all objects returned from a query. Let's look at some examples.

    ```javascript
    var mongoose = require('mongoose');
    var Schema = mongoose.Schema;

    var personSchema = Schema({
      _id: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      name: String,
      age: Number,
      stories: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Story' }]
    });

    var storySchema = Schema({
      author: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Person' },
      title: String,
      fans: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Person' }]
    });

    var Story = mongoose.model('Story', storySchema);
    var Person = mongoose.model('Person', personSchema);
    ```

    So far we've created two [Models](./models.html). Our `Person` model has
    its `stories` field set to an array of `ObjectId`s. The `ref` option is
    what tells Mongoose which model to use during population, in our case
    the `Story` model. All `_id`s we store here must be document `_id`s from
    the `Story` model.

    **Note**: `ObjectId`, `Number`, `String`, and `Buffer` are valid for use
    as refs. However, you should use `ObjectId` unless you are an advanced
    user and have a good reason for doing so.

    <h3 id="saving-refs"><a href="#saving-refs">Saving refs</a></h3>

    Saving refs to other documents works the same way you normally save
    properties, just assign the `_id` value:

    ```javascript
    var author = new Person({
      _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(),
      name: 'Ian Fleming',
      age: 50
    });

    author.save(function (err) {
      if (err) return handleError(err);

      var story1 = new Story({
        title: 'Casino Royale',
        author: author._id    // assign the _id from the person
      });

      story1.save(function (err) {
        if (err) return handleError(err);
        // thats it!
      });
    });
    ```

    <h3 id="population"><a href="#population">Population</a></h3>

    So far we haven't done anything much different. We've merely created a
    `Person` and a `Story`. Now let's take a look at populating our story's
    `author` using the query builder:

    ```javascript
    Story.
      findOne({ title: 'Casino Royale' }).
      populate('author').
      exec(function (err, story) {
        if (err) return handleError(err);
        console.log('The author is %s', story.author.name);
        // prints "The author is Ian Fleming"
      });
    ```

    Populated paths are no longer set to their original `_id` , their value
    is replaced with the mongoose document returned from the database by
    performing a separate query before returning the results.

    Arrays of refs work the same way. Just call the
    [populate](./api.html#query_Query-populate) method on the query and an
    array of documents will be returned _in place_ of the original `_id`s.

    <h3 id="setting-populated-fields"><a href="#setting-populated-fields">Setting Populated Fields</a></h3>

    In Mongoose >= 4.0, you can manually populate a field as well.

    ```javascript
    Story.findOne({ title: 'Casino Royale' }, function(error, story) {
      if (error) {
        return handleError(error);
      }
      story.author = author;
      console.log(story.author.name); // prints "Ian Fleming"
    });
    ```

    <h3 id="field-selection"><a href="#field-selection">Field Selection</a></h3>

    What if we only want a few specific fields returned for the populated
    documents? This can be accomplished by passing the usual
    [field name syntax](./api.html#query_Query-select) as the second argument
    to the populate method:

    ```javascript
    Story.
      findOne({ title: /casino royale/i }).
      populate('author', 'name'). // only return the Persons name
      exec(function (err, story) {
        if (err) return handleError(err);

        console.log('The author is %s', story.author.name);
        // prints "The author is Ian Fleming"

        console.log('The authors age is %s', story.author.age);
        // prints "The authors age is null'
      });
    ```

    <h3 id="populating-multiple-paths"><a href="#populating-multiple-paths">Populating Multiple Paths</a></h3>

    What if we wanted to populate multiple paths at the same time?

    ```javascript
    Story.
      find(...).
      populate('fans').
      populate('author').
      exec();
    ```

    If you call `populate()` multiple times with the same path, only the last
    one will take effect.

    ```javascript
    // The 2nd `populate()` call below overwrites the first because they
    // both populate 'fans'.
    Story.
      find().
      populate({ path: 'fans', select: 'name' }).
      populate({ path: 'fans', select: 'email' });
    // The above is equivalent to:
    Story.find().populate({ path: 'fans', select: 'email' });
    ```

    <h3 id="query-conditions"><a href="#query-conditions">Query conditions and other options</a></h3>

    What if we wanted to populate our fans array based on their age, select
    just their names, and return at most, any 5 of them?

    ```javascript
    Story.
      find(...).
      populate({
        path: 'fans',
        match: { age: { $gte: 21 }},
        // Explicitly exclude `_id`, see http://bit.ly/2aEfTdB
        select: 'name -_id',
        options: { limit: 5 }
      }).
      exec();
    ```

    <h3 id="refs-to-children"><a href="#refs-to-children">Refs to children</a></h3>

    We may find however, if we use the `author` object, we are unable to get a
    list of the stories. This is because no `story` objects were ever 'pushed'
    onto `author.stories`.

    There are two perspectives here. First, you may want the `author` know
    which stories are theirs. Usually, your schema should resolve
    one-to-many relationships by having a parent pointer in the 'many' side.
    But, if you have a good reason to want an array of child pointers, you
    can `push()` documents onto the array as shown below.

    ```javascript
    author.stories.push(story1);
    author.save(callback);
    ```

    This allows us to perform a `find` and `populate` combo:

    ```javascript
    Person.
      findOne({ name: 'Ian Fleming' }).
      populate('stories'). // only works if we pushed refs to children
      exec(function (err, person) {
        if (err) return handleError(err);
        console.log(person);
      });
    ```

    It is debatable that we really want two sets of pointers as they may get
    out of sync. Instead we could skip populating and directly `find()` the
    stories we are interested in.

    ```javascript
    Story.
      find({ author: author._id }).
      exec(function (err, stories) {
        if (err) return handleError(err);
        console.log('The stories are an array: ', stories);
      });
    ```

    The documents returned from
    [query population](./api.html#query_Query-populate) become fully
    functional, `remove`able, `save`able documents unless the
    [lean](./api.html#query_Query-lean) option is specified. Do not confuse
    them with [sub docs](./subdocs.html). Take caution when calling its
    remove method because you'll be removing it from the database, not just
    the array.

    <h3 id="populate_an_existing_mongoose_document"><a href="#populate_an_existing_mongoose_document">Populating an existing document</a></h3>

    If we have an existing mongoose document and want to populate some of its
    paths, **mongoose >= 3.6** supports the
    [document#populate()](./api.html#document_Document-populate) method.

    <h3 id="populate_multiple_documents"><a href="#populate_multiple_documents">Populating multiple existing documents</a></h3>

    If we have one or many mongoose documents or even plain objects
    (_like [mapReduce](./api.html#model_Model.mapReduce) output_), we may
    populate them using the [Model.populate()](./api.html#model_Model.populate)
    method available in **mongoose >= 3.6**. This is what `document#populate()`
    and `query#populate()` use to populate documents.

    <h3 id="deep-populate"><a href="#deep-populate">Populating across multiple levels</a></h3>

    Say you have a user schema which keeps track of the user's friends.

    ```javascript
    var userSchema = new Schema({
      name: String,
      friends: [{ type: ObjectId, ref: 'User' }]
    });
    ```

    Populate lets you get a list of a user's friends, but what if you also
    wanted a user's friends of friends? Specify the `populate` option to tell
    mongoose to populate the `friends` array of all the user's friends:

    ```javascript
    User.
      findOne({ name: 'Val' }).
      populate({
        path: 'friends',
        // Get friends of friends - populate the 'friends' array for every friend
        populate: { path: 'friends' }
      });
    ```

    <h3 id="cross-db-populate"><a href="#cross-db-populate">Populating across Databases</a></h3>

    Let's say you have a schema representing events, and a schema representing
    conversations. Each event has a corresponding conversation thread.

    ```javascript
    var eventSchema = new Schema({
      name: String,
      // The id of the corresponding conversation
      // Notice there's no ref here!
      conversation: ObjectId
    });
    var conversationSchema = new Schema({
      numMessages: Number
    });
    ```

    Also, suppose that events and conversations are stored in separate MongoDB
    instances.

    ```javascript
    var db1 = mongoose.createConnection('localhost:27000/db1');
    var db2 = mongoose.createConnection('localhost:27001/db2');

    var Event = db1.model('Event', eventSchema);
    var Conversation = db2.model('Conversation', conversationSchema);
    ```

    In this situation, you will **not** be able to `populate()` normally.
    The `conversation` field will always be null, because `populate()` doesn't
    know which model to use. However,
    [you can specify the model explicitly](./api.html#model_Model.populate).

    ```javascript
    Event.
      find().
      populate({ path: 'conversation', model: Conversation }).
      exec(function(error, docs) { /* ... */ });
    ```

    This is known as a "cross-database populate," because it enables you to
    populate across MongoDB databases and even across MongoDB instances.

    <h3 id="dynamic-ref"><a href="#dynamic-ref">Dynamic References</a></h3>

    Mongoose can also populate from multiple collections at the same time.
    Let's say you have a user schema that has an array of "connections" - a
    user can be connected to either other users or an organization.

    ```javascript
    var userSchema = new Schema({
      name: String,
      connections: [{
        kind: String,
        item: { type: ObjectId, refPath: 'connections.kind' }
      }]
    });

    var organizationSchema = new Schema({ name: String, kind: String });

    var User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
    var Organization = mongoose.model('Organization', organizationSchema);
    ```

    The `refPath` property above means that mongoose will look at the
    `connections.kind` path to determine which model to use for `populate()`.
    In other words, the `refPath` property enables you to make the `ref`
    property dynamic.

    ```javascript
    // Say we have one organization:
    // `{ _id: ObjectId('000000000000000000000001'), name: "Guns N' Roses", kind: 'Band' }`
    // And two users:
    // {
    //   _id: ObjectId('000000000000000000000002')
    //   name: 'Axl Rose',
    //   connections: [
    //     { kind: 'User', item: ObjectId('000000000000000000000003') },
    //     { kind: 'Organization', item: ObjectId('000000000000000000000001') }
    //   ]
    // },
    // {
    //   _id: ObjectId('000000000000000000000003')
    //   name: 'Slash',
    //   connections: []
    // }
    User.
      findOne({ name: 'Axl Rose' }).
      populate('connections.item').
      exec(function(error, doc) {
        // doc.connections[0].item is a User doc
        // doc.connections[1].item is an Organization doc
      });
    ```

    <h3 id="populate-virtuals"><a href="#populate-virtuals">Populate Virtuals</a></h3>

    _New in 4.5.0_

    So far you've only populated based on the `_id` field. However, that's
    sometimes not the right choice.
    In particular, [arrays that grow without bound are a MongoDB anti-pattern](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/model-referenced-one-to-many-relationships-between-documents/).
    Using mongoose virtuals, you can define more sophisticated relationships
    between documents.

    ```javascript
    var PersonSchema = new Schema({
      name: String,
      band: String
    });

    var BandSchema = new Schema({
      name: String
    });
    BandSchema.virtual('members', {
      ref: 'Person', // The model to use
      localField: 'name', // Find people where `localField`
      foreignField: 'band', // is equal to `foreignField`
      // If `justOne` is true, 'members' will be a single doc as opposed to
      // an array. `justOne` is false by default.
      justOne: false
    });

    var Person = mongoose.model('Person', PersonSchema);
    var Band = mongoose.model('Band', BandSchema);

    /**
     * Suppose you have 2 bands: "Guns N' Roses" and "Motley Crue"
     * And 4 people: "Axl Rose" and "Slash" with "Guns N' Roses", and
     * "Vince Neil" and "Nikki Sixx" with "Motley Crue"
     */
    Band.find({}).populate('members').exec(function(error, bands) {
      /* `bands.members` is now an array of instances of `Person` */
    });
    ```

    Keep in mind that virtuals are _not_ included in `toJSON()` output by default. If you want populate virtuals to show up when using functions
    that rely on `JSON.stringify()`, like Express'
    [`res.json()` function](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.json),
    set the `virtuals: true` option on your schema's `toJSON` options.

    ```javascript
    // Set `virtuals: true` so `res.json()` works
    var BandSchema = new Schema({
      name: String
    }, { toJSON: { virtuals: true } });
    ```

    If you're using populate projections, make sure `foreignField` is included
    in the projection.

    ```javascript
    Band.
      find({}).
      populate({ path: 'members', select: 'name' }).
      exec(function(error, bands) {
        // Won't work, foreign field `band` is not selected in the projection
      });

    Band.
      find({}).
      populate({ path: 'members', select: 'name band' }).
      exec(function(error, bands) {
        // Works, foreign field `band` is selected
      });
    ```

    <h3 id="populate-middleware"><a href="#populate-middleware">Populate in Middleware</a></h3>

    You can populate in either pre or post [hooks](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html). If you want to
    always populate a certain field, check out the [mongoose-autopopulate plugin](http://npmjs.com/package/mongoose-autopopulate).

    ```javascript
    // Always attach `populate()` to `find()` calls
    MySchema.pre('find', function() {
      this.populate('user');
    });
    ```

    ```javascript
    // Always `populate()` after `find()` calls. Useful if you want to selectively populate
    // based on the docs found.
    MySchema.post('find', async function(docs) {
      for (let doc of docs) {
        if (doc.isPublic) {
          await doc.populate('user').execPopulate();
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    ```javascript
    // `populate()` after saving. Useful for sending populated data back to the client in an
    // update API endpoint
    MySchema.post('save', function(doc, next) {
      doc.populate('user').execPopulate(function() {
        next();
      });
    });
    ```

    ### Next Up

    Now that we've covered `populate()`, let's take a look at [discriminators](/docs/discriminators.html).
