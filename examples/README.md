This directory contains runnable sample mongoose programs.

To run:

  - first install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
  - from the root of the project, execute `npm install -d`
  - in the example directory, run `npm install -d`
  - from the command line, execute: `node example.js`, replacing "example.js" with the name of a program.
